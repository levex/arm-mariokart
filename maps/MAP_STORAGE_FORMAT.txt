/* The map of the world as a big array of chunks (road elements + possibly other stuff like bushes etc.) 

/*
 * Each chunk is A x B in size (TBA)
 * The whole map is C x D (TBA) which is (C*D)/(A*B) chunks
 * Each byte is a number which corresponds to one of the following map components:
 *
 * 0:    nothing (concrete ground)
 *
 * 1:    road - straight - 0 degrees
 * 2:    road - straight - 45 degrees
 * 3:    road - straight - 90 degrees
 * 4:    road - straight - 135 degrees
 *
 * 901:  road - 90 degree curve - top left corner
 * 902:  road - 90 degree curve - top right corner
 * 903:  road - 90 degree curve - bottom right corner
 * 904:  road - 90 degree curve - bottom left corner
 *
 * 451:  road - 45 degree curve - top left corner
 * 452:  road - 45 degree curve - top right corner
 * 453:  road - 45 degree curve - bottom right corner
 * 454:  road - 45 degree curve - bottom left corner
 *
 * 4501: road - 45 degree curve filler - top left corner
 * 4502: road - 45 degree curve filler - top right corner
 * 4503: road - 45 degree curve filler - bottom left corner
 * 4504: road - 45 degree curve filler - bottom right corner
 *
 * Objects:
 *
 * 9991: bush
 * 9992: tree
 *
 * Any other number is treated as 0
 * 
 * The actual map file is a text file (.map) with the following format:
 * Line 1: map width
 * Line 2: map height
 * Line 3: chunk width
 * Line 4: chunk height
 * Line 5: [chunk 1] [chunk 2] [chunk 3]
 * Line 6: [chunk 4] [chunk 5] [chunk 6]
 * Line 7: [chunk 7] [chunk 8] [chunk 9]
 * ... etc - chunks are stored row major, where each line is the next row (so the above map is 3 chunks wide)
 * Chunks are seperated by any amount of whitespace
